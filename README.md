# Visual illusion induced by sound

## *Shams et al. - 2000 - What you see is what you hear*

## Experiment description
The main goal of this experiment is to show that visual perception can be influenced by auditory stimuli. Between one and four white uniform circles and between zero and five beeps are presented to the subject at the same time. Their goal is to count the number of flashes and to ignore the number of beeps.

## PCBS project

The goal of the project is to mimic the experiment done by *Shams et al.* and to reproduce the main figures found by the authors. Overall, it is to assess whether a visual illusion can be induced by sound with simple stimuli.

## To run the experiment

The experiment can be run on every computer on which expyriment, numpy and matplotlib are installed. The main results of the user's experiment are displayed with matplotlib. 

## Previous experience

I have a rather good coding experience using python but I never used expyriment before neither coded an experiment.
This class taught me how to do both!
